# MLOps World: Gen AI Summit 2025

Welcome to the **MLOps World: Gen AI Summit 2025**! 

In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn to build your own ChatGPT-like application using OpenAI's latest tools and frameworks. We'll follow the journey from simple prompting to an agentic systems - the same kind of evolution that transformed ChatGPT from an LLM with a front end into the powerful platform it is today.

For aspiring AI Engineers, this is one of the best ways to learn to build 🏗️, ship 🚢, and share 🚀 customized LLM applications.
