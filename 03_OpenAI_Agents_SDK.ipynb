            "\n",
            "🔑 Key Insights:\n",
            "  • Prioritize semantic/structure-aware chunking (e.g., LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, LlamaIndex SemanticSplitter) with ~10–20% overlap to preserve coherence.\n",
            "  • Align chunk size/overlap with model context window and content type; adjust similarity_top_k when chunk size changes.\n",

            "  [HIGH] Define your objective for the session (e.g., reduce RAG tokens 30% without hurting faithfulness; fix retrieval misses on multi-section PDFs). (5 min)\n",
